{"name":"Mightyscreen","tagline":"A tool that can help screeners with their data","body":"## Welcome to MightyScreen Pages.\r\nMightyScreen is a simple but comprehensive data analysis tool for high-throughput screens. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use.\r\nSimply upload your data file and start playing. \r\nDon't have data? You can click \"Load Demo\" button in upload page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supported file format.\r\n####file format\r\nCSV files\r\n\r\n####supported plate format\r\nThe program is only tested on 384-plate format. But to support other plate format is not hard. Please send us a sample input file and we can add support to that.\r\n\r\n####required columns\r\n    plate, well\r\nthese 2 columns are required by MightyScreen.\r\n\r\n####reserved name spaces\r\n    identifier, plate_well, hit, welltype, create_date\r\nMightyScreen already specified the meaning for the above columns. You can choose to include them or not, but don't name your experimental readouts with these names.\r\n\r\n####supported chemical identifiers\r\n    name, cid, name, smiles, inchi, sdf, inchikey, formula, listkey, identifier(the export file from MightyScreen)\r\nColumns with these will be used to connect your screening compound to PubChem chemical records. But they are not required.\r\nFor ICCB users, these are not required, just choose HMS as chemical identifier when uploading. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Am I required to register?\r\nDefinitely not. Anonymous users have all the functionalities but we recommend user to register before they start doing relatively long term projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Data policy.\r\nWe currently have 4T storage space for the incoming data. But eventually we gonna get to a point that we need to clean up old data. The currently plan is to delete data that is over 6 months old. So, please don't reply on mightyscreen to store your data. Often keep an backup of your data using 'ExportData' in the menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute.\r\nWe welcome any support from our community. Please fork our rep and hack away. We'll try to merge them in on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor: @longfei-wang\r\nContributor: @yangqinwhu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact or Bug report.\r\nYou are welcome to write to mightyscreen@gmail.com.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
